# Ink Blockchain Dashboard Using SQL on Flipside Crypto.
On-chain data analysis using Flipside Crypto platform. Use of SQL queries and dashboard for the Ink blockchain activities.

üîó **Live Dashboard:** [HERE](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/ivy-k/ink-chain-transaction-and-activity-analysis-5HtJbK)

## Description:

Developed an interactive dashboard using Flipside Crypto to analyse the Ink blockchain token transactions and user activity. 
Extracted on-chain data with SQL, filtered high-volume tokens and visualised trends in transaction volume, token usage and user behaviour to support data-driven insights into the blockchain activity.

## Key Insights:

-  **Unique Wallet Participation:**
     Monthly active wallet count showed consistent growth up to January 2025, reflecting increasing user engagement. However, activity has declined since then, likely due to broader market conditions.

-  **Smart Contract Usage:** A large portion of transactions are contract-related, suggesting INK is used for more than just transfers ‚Äî possibly dApps or token interactions. This metric has shown steady growth over time.
-  **Developer Activity:** Weekly unique contract deployers spiked in January and March 2025, but overall developer activity remains relatively low, suggesting a small but occasionally active builder community.
-  **Token Transfer Pattern:** WETH and stablecoins dominate transfer volume on INK, signaling that the chain is primarily used for financial transactions like trading, bridging, or liquidity movement ‚Äî rather than for speculative or entertainment use cases (e.g., meme tokens or NFTs).

## Potential Use Cases:
- **For protocol teams**: Monitor user and dev adoption on INK.
- **For investors**: Evaluate chain utility (finance-focused vs. speculative).
- **For analysts**: Benchmark growth against other Layer2s.
  
## üõ† Tools Used:
